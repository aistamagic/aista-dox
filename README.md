## Installation

To use the theme add something resembling the following to your YAML configuration file _"\_config.yml"_.

```
remote_theme: polterguy/aista-jekyll
permalink: /blog/:title
title: Title of your site
description: Slogan of your site
google_analytics: UA-123456789-1
copyright: Â© Foo, Ltd 2022
mwr: /section-1/foo
mwr_text: Foo 1
og_image: https://some-url.com/to-open-graph-image.jpeg
nav_sections:
  - name: Section 1
    items:
      - url: /section-1/foo
        name: Foo 1
      - url: /section-1/bar
        name: Foo 2
  - name: Section 2
    items:
      - url: /section-2/
        name: Another foo
```

The `remote_theme` parts needs to be exactly as above, the rest is intended for configuring your site, and include
Google Analytics tracking codes, MWR (_"Most Wanted Response"_, a link on your site being the most important navigation hyperlink),
and navigation sections, etc. The navigation sections becomes a navbar that you can toggle at the top of your page
using a hamburger button.

## Usage

The theme is blog aware, assuming you save your blog posts into your _"\_posts"_ folder. To list your blog items, create
an HTML page and store at your root folder called for instance _"blog.html"_, and fill it with the following content.

```html
---
layout: default
title: The title of your blog
---
<h1>The title of your blog</h1>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

To create a single blog item, create a file called for instance _"2022-01-04-new-documentation-website.md"_ and store it
into your _"\_posts"_ folder and fill it as follows.

```markdown

layout: post
